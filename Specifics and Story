ADD WHAT YOU THINK WILL BENEFIT THE GAME

Summary of game idea/storyline: You play through a game where you fight monsters, solve puzzles, help
others, and become the greatest hero in the land (or stuff like that). At the end of the
game, you wake up from a coma of two months (there can be hints and such throughout
the game to suggest that the majority of the game is in a dream-state). The coma is
due to an attempt where the main character (you) tried to kill him or herself. 

Ideas to improve the story:
- when you awake from the coma, the doctor comes in and says, according to some test
that you have overcome all the chemical imbalances in your brain (slaying the monsters
and solving puzzles).
