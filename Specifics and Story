ADD WHAT YOU THINK WILL BENEFIT THE GAME

Summary of game idea/storyline: You play through a game where you fight monsters, solve puzzles, help
others, and become the greatest hero in the land (or stuff like that). At the end of the
game, you wake up from a coma of two months (there can be hints and such throughout
the game to suggest that the majority of the game is in a dream-state). The coma is
due to an attempt where the main character (you) tried to kill him or herself. 

Ideas to improve the story:
- when you awake from the coma, the doctor comes in and says, according to some test
that you have overcome all the chemical imbalances in your brain (slaying the monsters
and solving puzzles).
-After progressing through what can be perceived as an easy "tutorial" area, protagonist approaches
what appears to be a large monster in a dead end. Upon defeating it, a portal opens up in that area.
Yet to be dtermined whether this will be time travel, like implementing accessing memories while still fighting
through the game, or inter-dimensional travel to show seeing things from different sides and possibly
implying multiple personality-esque disorder. Either way, the mechanic will be applied by keeping the general
shape of the world, but applying a different skin, ala Chrono Trigger or A Link to the Past (Light vs Dark World),
except there will be multiple dimensions or times to travel between. Upon traveling through these portals not only
does the world change around you to symbolize the character's mental health, but also their 
items, armor, and any inventory. This it to throw the player off,
never really allowing them to feel completely comfortable and always feel the need to explore.
